This is a repository in which my personal projects related to data science are stored.
Since a few months, I have started to work on projects with tools like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** and **NumPy**.
My work mainly focuses on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and to proceed I used to answer some business questions.
